We identified previous e-commerce marketing approaches to derive user behavior prediction. A deep learning method for real-time customer churn prediction showed an appropriate result. We applied our research to online shopping malls to raise conversion rates and sales. To check whether our experiment carried out monetary value, we developed a framework to measure the sales amount when used with a segment model and personalized recommended digital coupons. We found that our model shows the best results. We found it is suitable for e-commerce online shopping malls to raise conversion rates and sales. Our study empirically showed that marketing, which was a field of management, could be solved more efficiently and quickly by applying big data and deep learning technology.
